Lab 1 README Jacob Dietrich

Q1: Was this lab fun?
A: This lab was fun, but very tedious given that the images need to be precise.
	I would rate it as a 7 on a scale of 1-10.

Q2: How was the writeup for the lab?
A: The writeup for this lab was a little difficult to understand, but I was able
	to complete it by referencing the "What to do" section, which was very
	straightforward.  I do not think it was too much hand holding, it was 
	just the right amount of thoroughness.

Q3: How long did this lab take you?
A: This lab took me about 5 hours total or so.  I also had a two year old around
	me as well as being distracted by family members, so that had something
	to do with it.  The time it takes to finish this lab depends on how much
	the student believes is enough detail in the image.
